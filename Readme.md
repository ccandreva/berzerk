# Berzerk

They say a good starting point to learn Godot (or any game engine) is to
write a classic game. I've wanted to do Berzerk for a while, and finally am
trying my heand at it.

## Scoring
50 points on each robot death, no matter how it dies.
10 points per robot on all robots dying, even if Otto gets you
   before you leave.
